## Alpha
A term applied to the first monsters. The Alpha Werewolf was the first werewolf and all other werewolves trace their ancestry back to him, the Alpha Vampire was the first vampire, and so on. These are much more powerful versions of their children.

## Banish
Spirits and spirit-like entities, such as demons and angels, can be banished by striking their natural form with iron or through an exorcism. Banishing a spirit does not destroy it, but forces it to leave whatever body it is possessing and flee the scene. It will return after it has had a chance to recover.

## Blessed Weapons
Weapons that have gone through a religious ritual to imbue them with holy power. The ritual makes them especially effective against creatures from Hell or undead monsters, such as demons, ghosts, vampires, and zombies.

## The Chroniclers
An ancient order of academics who studied and researched the supernatural. They kept heavily fortified libraries full of information about monsters and magic, along with tons of equipment for dealing with supernatural creatures. The order is long gone, but their descendants still possess the means to open these bunkers.

## Crossroads Demon
A breed of demon that specializes in forming deals with desperate humans. In exchange for talent, money, fame, or other worldly desires, the mortal agrees to forfeit their soul to Hell in 10 years time. Usually, the crossroads demon dispatches a hellhound to collect the human.

## Death
The leader of the reapers and the personification of death. He is older than the universe and has existed as long as there has been life. He views mortals as less than ants and hates being disturbed. However, he has started to develop a taste for mortal junk food.

## Damage
Many of the Talents and Assets in *Iron & Salt* deal damage and require a challenge. Whenever this is the case, the Talent or Asset deals its damage in addition to whatever damage is dealt by the successful challenge. For instance, the Grenades from the Mountain card says `deal 3 Strikes of damage to all creatures within range` and require a Gales challenge to use. On a Gales challenge of 2, if a player rolls 4 Successes, the attack deals 2 Strikes of damage from the challenge plus 3 Strikes of damage from using the Asset, for a total of 5 Strikes.

## Demon
A soldier of Hell, usually in charge of torturing the souls of mortals who are judged as evil and sentenced to an eternity in Hell. They can manifest on Earth as clouds of smoke and can take possession of humans (living or dead). While wearing a human, they are incredibly strong and some possess magical abilities.

## Faerie
A being from the Fae Realm, a world parallel to our own. Fairies are normally very playful and mischievous, but they view humans as cattle and won't think twice about killing a few during "playtime".

## Gold
A precious earthly metal. Many monsters, especially those from the Fae Realm, love gold and its shininess. It can also be used to destroy some spirits, such as banshees.

## Hand of God
Any artifact with a strong connection to the divine. The Spear of Longinus, the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, the Staff of Moses, and the Three Nails of the Cross are just a few. These artifacts possess strong divine power and are extremely effective against denizens of Hell.

## H.U.N.T.E.R.
The Hostile Unnatural and Natural Threat Engagement Regiment (or H.U.N.T.E.R.) was a branch of the military that was founded when a man who believed in the supernatural was elected to a high position in the federal government. He acquired enough funding and support to put together his own military regiment, dedicated to exterminating monsters. They did good work for a while, hunting things and saving innocent lives. However, they had a bad habit of making conclusions based on too little information. A lot of their databases and briefing materials were filled with improper ways to eliminate things. Their bad record-keeping and information gathering, plus the unstable sanity of their leader, eventually led to his death at the hands of a simple vampire. Without any outside support, the regiment was disbanded.

## Iron
A symbol of the Earth and the powers of nature. Iron, as an earthly metal, is effective at dispelling ghosts and spirits.

## Knight of Hell
A high ranking demon of Hell. The Knights usually report to a Prince of Hell or Lucifer himself. All other demons report to a Knight or to a lieutenant appointed by the Knight.

## Legendary Weapons
Weapons from ancient times, when monsters roamed the Earth more freely. They are typically medieval weapons, such as swords and shields, although there is a gun or two among them as well. These weapons were forged to slay dragons and the worst of the monsters. They are immensely powerful and can kill many things that normally cannot be killed.

## Lucifer
The Devil himself.

## Mortal Means
Any method of killing that is effective on normal humans.

## Possession
The natural form of spirits, demons, and angels is gaseous with varying levels of recognizability. Demons are formless black or red smoke, angels are white motes of light, and ghosts look like spectral humanoids. All spirits have the ability to inhabit living mortals to varying degrees, while some can inhabit corpses as well. While possessed, the owner of the body has no control, but is aware of everything that is happening. Attacking the body physically does little to damage the spirit inside, but once the spirit leaves, the owner of the body still suffers the injuries inflicted on it, up to and including fatal injuries.

## Prince of Hell
The highest ranking demons in Hell. Much more powerful than normal demons. Usually report to Lucifer himself.

## Reaper
A servant of Death, charged with escorting the recently deceased to the other side. They appear only to their victim or to those with special senses. Some look like they walked out of a storybook, with the dark cowl and the scythe, while others prefer a more pleasant appearance, and will wear a black formal suit or dress.

## Salt
A symbol of cleansing and sterilization. When sprinkled across a threshold, such as a door or a window, or formed into a circle, salt becomes an effective barrier against ghosts, spirits, and other undead creatures. Could be normal table salt, road salt, or even salt water.

## Silver
An earthly metal effective against a large assortment of living supernatural creatures, such as werewolves, shifters, and djinn.

## Spirit
Ghosts, banshees, and various other spirits exist in this world. They cannot touch or be touched physically. With great will, they can manage to make one body part solid enough to affect the physical world. They can fly and pass through walls. They can be temporarily dispelled by striking them with iron or another earthly metal, they cannot cross a barrier of salt, they can be banished with an exorcism, and those that were once living can be permanently destroyed by salting and burning their remains or whatever object they are linked to. Demons are never linked to an object.

## Spirit Trap
A circular marking made on the floor or ceiling that can trap a demon that enters it. Can be made with anything from paint to blood or even just scratches on the floor. Every hunter knows how to make one, but most demons are too smart to get caught in one.

## Weaknesses
Many monsters are weak against particular types of attacks: ghosts are vulnerable to holy water and iron, werewolves are vulnerable to silver, zombies are vulnerable to fire, etc. In the world of *Iron & Salt*, attacking a monster's weakness does not do extra damage and probably won't kill it immediately, but if the killing blow is dealt with something **other** than the monster's weakness, the monster will survive to fight another day. So make sure you wear that monster down with other attacks before moving in to finish it off with its weakness.
